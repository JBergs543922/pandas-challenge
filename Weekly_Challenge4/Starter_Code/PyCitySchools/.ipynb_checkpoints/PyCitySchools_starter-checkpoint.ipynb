    "- school_summary Analysis:\n",
    "- Our initial table does not provided much data. We can see that our mathematics test scores and pass rates lag behind reading scores and rates across the 15 schools in our school district.\n",
    "\n",
    "- per_school_summary Analysis:\n",
    "- Here we can examine some details, which could point to the discrepancy between math and reading scores/pass rates. \n",
    "- Firstly, the greater reading pass rate is consistent in the highest and lowest scoring schools. Math passing rates seem to lag behind reading across the board. \n",
    "- Second, we can observe that the total budgets and per capita budgets are not vastly different between each set of five schools. There are lower and high per capita values in both lists. However, a common factor among the highest performing schools is that they are charter, while the lowest performing schools are district.\n",
    "- Third, the five highest schools seem to have a significantly lower population, than the five lowest performing schools. The lower passing rate might not be an issue of money and more one of student to staff ratio. This conclusion is supported by the groupings in the latter portion of the analysis. School size and type seem to make the biggest difference in passing scores.\n",
